# pdf_search.py

A command-line tool for bulk-scanning a folder of PDFs to extract embedded
links, URLs found in visible text, keyword matches, (optionally) Bates
numbers, and (optionally) citations of file names (source code or specific
extensions). Results are aggregated and written to a formatted Excel
workbook, with large reference lists offloaded to companion JSON files.

Useful for document review, e-discovery, and auditing large sets of PDFs for
specific links or terms without opening each file by hand.

## Capabilities

- **Single-file or folder scanning**: by default, processes one PDF file.
  Pass `--folder` to instead recursively scan a folder (and all subfolders)
  for `.pdf` files.
- **Link annotation extraction** (`--link-annotations`): pulls embedded
  hyperlinks (URI annotations) from each PDF.
- **Text URL extraction** (`--text-urls`): scans visible page text for
  URL-like strings using a regex, even if they aren't embedded as clickable
  links.
- **Keyword search** (`--keywords`, `--keywords-file`): case-insensitive
  search for one or more literal terms across the visible text of every page.
- **Bates numbering — footer** (`--bates-footer-prefix`): detects Bates
  numbers in the bottom-right corner of each page matching a given prefix
  (e.g. `MyCompany_000123`), and attaches the detected ID to every match
  found on that page.
- **Bates numbering — body** (`--bates-body`): scans each page's visible
  text/content for *any* Bates-style reference numbers (letter prefix +
  padded digit run, e.g. `ACME-000123`), regardless of prefix — not just the
  page's own stamp. Useful for catching Bates numbers cited in the document
  body that reference other document sets. Each match gets its own `Context`
  snippet, and results are grouped into a dedicated `Bates Numbers` sheet
  (same structure as the `Keywords` sheet). Can be combined with
  `--bates-footer-prefix`, which is attached to each body match's reference
  entry for cross-referencing.
- **File citation search** (`--source-code`, `--file-ext`): scans each
  page's visible text for citations of file names — either common source-code
  file names (`.py`, `.js`, `.ts`, `.java`, `.c`, ...) via `--source-code`,
  or any specific extension(s) you name via `--file-ext py txt`, etc. The two
  options combine into a single search. Each match keeps its own `Context`
  snippet, and results are grouped by file path into a dedicated
  `File Citations` sheet (same structure as the `Bates Numbers` sheet). Useful
  for finding where a brief, memo, or transcript cites particular source files
  or documents by name.
- **Context extraction**: each match includes surrounding text
  (`--context-window` characters before/after) to help you see it in
  context without opening the source PDF.
- **De-duplication & grouping**: matches are grouped by exact URL/keyword/Bates number/file
  name across the whole document set, with a reference count and a list of
  every file/page/context where it occurred.
- **Excel output**: results are written to an auto-formatted `.xlsx` file
  (bold headers, wrapped text, auto-sized columns), with any combination of
  `URLs`, `Keywords`, `Bates Numbers`, and `File Citations` sheets depending
  on which options were used.
- **Overflow handling**: if a match's reference list is too large to fit
  cleanly in a cell, it's saved to a separate JSON file in a
  `references_json/` subfolder, and the cell instead shows a pointer like
  `[See somefile.json]`.
- **Non-destructive output**: each run gets its own uniquely-numbered folder
  under `output/` (e.g. `output/run`, `output/run_1`, `output/run_2`, ...), so
  repeated runs never overwrite previous results.

## Installation

Requires Python 3.8+.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # on Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Dependencies (see [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)):

- [PyMuPDF](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/) (`fitz`) — PDF parsing
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) — data aggregation

- [openpyxl](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/) — Excel output/formatting

## Usage

```bash
python3 pdf_search.py <path> [options]
```

`<path>` is the only required argument. By default it's treated as a single
PDF file. Pass `--folder` to instead treat it as a folder, which will be
scanned recursively for `.pdf` files. You must also pass at least one of
`--link-annotations`, `--text-urls`, `--keywords`/`--keywords-file`,
`--bates-body`, `--source-code`, or `--file-ext` to get any output; the script
does nothing on its own.

### Options

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `path` | (positional, required) Path to a single PDF file (default), or a folder when `--folder` is set. |
| `--folder` | Treat `path` as a folder and recursively scan it for PDF files, instead of a single PDF file. |
| `--output PATH` | Output Excel filename. Default: `pdf_extraction_output.xlsx`. The file is placed inside an auto-generated run folder under `output/`. |
| `--link-annotations` | Extract embedded link annotations (clickable URIs) from each PDF. |
| `--text-urls` | Extract URL-like strings found in the visible page text. |
| `--keywords WORD [WORD ...]` | One or more keywords/phrases to search for (case-insensitive, literal match). Can be combined with `--keywords-file`. |
| `--keywords-file PATH` | Path to a text file with one keyword per line; appended to `--keywords`. |
| `--bates-footer-prefix PREFIX` | Prefix used to identify Bates numbers in the bottom-right footer of each page (e.g. `MyCompany` matches `MyCompany_000123`). Adds a `Bates ID (Footer)` column to results. |
| `--bates-body` | Scan each page's visible text/content for any Bates-style reference numbers (any prefix), not just the footer. Each match is captured with its own `Context` snippet and grouped into a `Bates Numbers` sheet. Can be combined with `--bates-footer-prefix`. |
| `--source-code` | Search each page's visible text for citations of common source code file names (`.py`, `.js`, `.ts`, `.jsx`, `.tsx`, `.c`, `.h`, `.cpp`, `.hpp`, `.cs`, `.java`, `.rb`, `.go`, `.rs`, `.swift`, `.kt`, `.scala`, `.php`, `.sh`, `.bash`, `.ps1`, `.m`, `.mm`, `.lua`, `.pl`, `.r`). Can be combined with `--file-ext`. |
| `--file-ext EXT [EXT ...]` | One or more specific file extensions to search for (e.g. `--file-ext py txt`). Accepts extensions with or without a leading dot. Can be combined with `--source-code` to search both sets at once. |
| `--context-window N` | Number of characters of surrounding text to include before/after each match in the `Context` column. Default: `100`. |

### Examples

Extract every embedded link and text-based URL from a single PDF:

```bash
python3 pdf_search.py document.pdf --link-annotations --text-urls
```

Scan an entire folder of PDFs for specific keywords, with footer Bates number tagging:

```bash
python3 pdf_search.py ./docs --folder --keywords "confidential" "settlement" --bates-footer-prefix ACME
```

Search using a keyword list file, with a wider context window:

```bash
python3 pdf_search.py ./docs --folder --keywords-file terms.txt --context-window 200
```

Tag matches with both the page's own footer Bates number and any Bates
numbers referenced elsewhere in the page content (e.g. citations to other
document sets):

```bash
python3 pdf_search.py ./docs --folder --keywords-file terms.txt \
  --bates-footer-prefix ACME \
  --bates-body
```

Find every source-code file cited in the documents:

```bash
python3 pdf_search.py ./docs --folder --source-code
```

Find citations of specific file types (any extensions you name), including
non-source ones like Office documents:

```bash
python3 pdf_search.py ./docs --folder --file-ext pdf docx csv
```

Do everything at once, over a folder, with a custom output filename:

```bash
python3 pdf_search.py ./docs --folder \
  --link-annotations \
  --text-urls \
  --keywords-file terms.txt \
  --bates-footer-prefix ACME \
  --bates-body \
  --source-code \
  --file-ext pdf \
  --output review_results.xlsx
```

## Output

Each run creates a new folder under `output/` (e.g. `output/review_results`,
incrementing with `_1`, `_2`, ... if the name is already taken), containing:

- **`<output>.xlsx`** — the results workbook:
  - **`URLs` sheet** (if `--link-annotations` and/or `--text-urls` used):
    one row per unique URL, with `Base URL` (domain), `Match Type`
    (`link` or `text_url`), `Reference Count`, and `References` (list of
    every filename/page/context where it appeared, plus `Bates ID (Footer)`
    if that option was used).
  - **`Keywords` sheet** (if keywords used): one row per unique matched
    keyword, with `Match Type`, `Reference Count`, and `References` (same
    structure as above).
  - **`Bates Numbers` sheet** (if `--bates-body` used): one row per unique
    Bates-style number found anywhere in the page content, with
    `Reference Count` and `References` (filename/page/context for every
    occurrence, plus `Bates ID (Footer)` if that option was also used).
  - **`File Citations` sheet** (if `--source-code` and/or `--file-ext`
    used): one row per unique cited file path, with `Match Type`
    (`file_citation`), `Reference Count`, and `References`
    (filename/page/context for every occurrence, plus `Bates ID (Footer)`
    if that option was also used).
- **`references_json/`** — JSON files for any match whose full reference
  list was too large to embed directly in the spreadsheet cell; the cell
  will contain a `[See <file>.json]` pointer instead.

If no links, keywords, Bates numbers, or file citations are found, no Excel
file is written and the script prints a message to that effect.
